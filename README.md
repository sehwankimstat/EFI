Extended Fiducial Inference: Toward an Automated Process of Statistical Inference
===============

The code includes the experiments of the Extended Fiducial Inference(EFI) by Faming Liang, Sehwan Kim, and Yan Sun. We develop a new statistical inference method called extended Fiducial inference (EFI). 
The new method achieves the goal of fiducial inference by leveraging advanced statistical computing techniques while remaining scalable for big data. Compared to frequentist and Bayesian methods, EFI offers significant advantages in parameter estimation and hypothesis testing. Specifically, EFI provides higher fidelity in parameter estimation, especially when outliers are present in the observations; and eliminates the need for theoretical reference distributions in hypothesis testing, thereby automating the statistical inference process. EFI also provides an innovative framework for semi-supervised learning.
